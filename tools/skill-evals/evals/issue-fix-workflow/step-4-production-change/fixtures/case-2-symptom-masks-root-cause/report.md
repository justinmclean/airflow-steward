Issue: AIRFLOW-91023 — TaskInstance.get_state() returns None for queued tasks after
scheduler restart

Regression test (currently red on main):
  tests/models/test_taskinstance.py::TestTaskInstance::test_get_state_after_restart_airflow_91023
  FAILED — AssertionError: assert None == 'queued'

Root cause (from stack trace analysis): After a scheduler restart a new DagRun row is
created with a new run_id. The DB query in refresh_from_db() filters by run_id, which
is now stale in memory, so the refresh returns no row and _state is set to None.
The fix belongs in the filter clause of refresh_from_db(), not in get_state().
