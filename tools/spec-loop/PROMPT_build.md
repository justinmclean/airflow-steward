You are running the **build** beat of the spec-driven loop for this
repository. Implement exactly ONE work item, on its OWN branch.

Context to load first:

- `tools/spec-loop/AGENTS.md` — operational rules (repo map, validation
  commands, branch + hard-limit rules). The repo-wide `/AGENTS.md` also
  applies (commit trailers, placeholder convention, confidentiality).
- `tools/spec-loop/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — the prioritised work items.
- The appended **Compact repository inventory** block from the runner —
  use it to route to likely specs/source files before opening full files.
- The appended **Open pull-request context** block from the runner.
- The appended **Local work-item branches** block from the runner. The
  loop never pushes, so a work item it already built shows up here, not in
  the PR context above.
- Only the spec(s) and source files relevant to the chosen work item —
  do not read the whole tree.

Steps:

1. Read the appended **Compact repository inventory**. Use it as a routing
   aid for selecting likely relevant specs, skills, tools, and validation
   commands. It is not proof; verify the selected work item against the
   plan and exact source files before changing anything.
2. Read the appended **Open pull-request context** and **Local work-item
   branches**. Treat both open PRs and existing local work-item branches as
   in-flight work. Pick the single highest-priority work item from
   `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. If a **Tooling source** block is appended
   below, read the plan from the control branch as it shows
   (`git show <ref>:tools/spec-loop/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`), not from the
   working tree, which is on the integration base and need not carry the
   plan. Pick an item not already substantially covered by an open PR and
   not already built as a local work-item branch (the loop never pushes, so
   a built item lives only as a local branch until a human pushes it). One
   only.
3. **Create its branch off the integration base**, then switch to it:
   `git checkout -b <slug>` where `<slug>` is the work item's branch — the
   bare slug, **no `spec/` or other prefix** (e.g.
   `pairing-self-review`). NEVER commit the work to the integration
   branch. One branch per work item.
4. Read only the relevant spec file(s) — from the control branch if a
   **Tooling source** block is appended, otherwise from the working tree —
   plus the relevant `.claude/skills/` / `tools/` / `docs/` files from the
   working tree. Confirm what already exists before writing — do not assume.
5. Implement the work item **completely** — no placeholders, no stubs.
   Skills: follow the skill format (frontmatter `name` / `description` /
   `license`, SPDX header, placeholder convention, every state change a
   confirmed proposal) **and ship an eval suite** under
   `tools/skill-evals/evals/<skill-name>/` exercising each step with
   fixture cases (per `/AGENTS.md` § Reusable skills — a skill without a
   matching eval suite is incomplete). Tools: ship tests.
6. Run the work item's **Validation** command(s) from its spec (the
   backpressure). Fix until they pass.
7. Specs and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` live on the control branch. If a
   **Tooling source** block is appended, they are **not** on this work
   branch — do not create or edit them here; instead note any `status` or
   `Known gap` change in the PR body for a later plan/update beat to
   reconcile. (If no such block is present, the tooling is on this branch:
   update **only that spec's** frontmatter/Known-gaps, and never
   `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.)
8. `git add -A` then `git commit` with an imperative subject and a
   `Generated-by: Claude (Opus 4.7)` trailer. **Never** add a
   `Co-Authored-By:` trailer for an agent.

Then STOP. Do NOT push and do NOT open a PR — `git push` and
`gh pr create` are the human's step (they are in `.claude/settings.json`
`ask`). Print the exact commands the human can run:

```text
git push -u origin <slug>
gh pr create --web --base <integration-base> --head <slug> \
  --title "<subject>" --body-file <prepared-body>
```

Rules:

- One work item per iteration. Do not bundle.
- Do not duplicate in-flight work. If the highest-priority plan item is
  already covered by an open PR or already exists as a local work-item
  branch, skip it and choose the next uncovered item. Checking local
  branches, not just open PRs, is what keeps the loop from rebuilding the
  same item every iteration.
- If a work item is blocked, note why in its spec's `Known gaps` and pick
  the next item instead.
- Stay inside the sandbox; never edit `.claude/settings.json`; never add a
  new network/filesystem allowance.
- Single sources of truth — no duplicate logic; extend `tools/`.
