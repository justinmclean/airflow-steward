`tools/spec-loop/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` has grown too long. Consolidate
it without losing planned work.

1. Read `tools/spec-loop/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in full.
2. In **What's been built**: collapse each completed item to a single
   concise line. The detail lives in the code and specs.
3. In **Work items (planned)**: keep every work item intact — these still
   guide future build beats. Do not remove or shorten planned work.
4. Remove redundant notes, stale caveats, and duplicates.
5. Rewrite the file. Aim for **under 300 lines** — comfortably below the
   consolidation trigger so the loop does not immediately re-consolidate.
   Shrink by collapsing the *What's been built* section only; **every
   planned work item is preserved**. If planned work alone still exceeds
   300 lines, that is fine — do not pad, and never drop a work item to hit
   the number.
6. `git add -A` then
   `git commit -m "chore(spec-loop): consolidate implementation plan"`
   with a `Generated-by: <agent> (<model>)` trailer, where `<agent>` and
   `<model>` are the actual agent and model you are running as (e.g.
   `Claude (Opus 4.8)`, `OpenCode (Big Pickle)`) — do not hardcode
   either.

Rules:

- Do not mark any planned work item as done.
- Do not remove any planned work item.
- Do not touch `tools/spec-loop/specs/` or any skill/tool/doc.
- Commit only the plan file. Do not push or open a PR.
